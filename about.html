          <p>
            I'm a coder and a sketch artist from Bangalore, India. I enjoy
            taking complex problems and bringing out simple and easy solutions
            for it. I also love the logic and structure of coding and always
            strive to write elegant and efficient code, whether it be HTML, CSS,
            Java, C or C++. I'm a fan of  clean, simple design with high attention 
            to detail and a dash of humour.<br />When I'm not coding or sketching, you will
            find me in the basketball ground or eating ice-cream.  
          <!--  I'm a 4th year undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering from New Horizon College of Engineering, Bangalore. Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. As I went through the BASIC tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in those funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity.
          </br></br>
This passion carried me through my education in CSE. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from "Hello World" all the way to creating a simple portfolio website of my own, with dozens of projects in between.
</br></br>
Front-end web development calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course).
</br></br>
I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind of like those web pages; I'm moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intact.
</br></br>
I am details-oriented, responsible and carry a get-it-done attitude regarding everything. I'm highly competitive against myself and others. Basketball is my sport and have played competitively my whole life (and still do). I'm a realist. I love the challenge of being told 'no' and turning it to a 'yes'. My superpower is my tenacity and my personal mantra is 'never leave anything to chance'.
</br></br>
My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, sketching, problem solving, and considerably good people skills. So far I have JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, C, C++, Bootstrap, and Git/GitHub under my belt. I've started learning Python, Machine Learning, Illustrator and Sketch. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
</br></br>
I believe in the power of team work and maintaining harmony in the same. I can work in a dynamic and rapidly-changing environment with great ease. So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
